The app has two main screens: HomeScreen for displaying the product list and CartScreen for displaying the selected items in the cart.The app uses reusable components like ProductItem and CartItem to display individual products and cart items.AsyncStorage is used to store the selected items locally on the device.The app uses functional components and hooks, which is the recommended way to write React Native apps.When the user adds or removes an item from the cart, the updated cart is stored in AsyncStorage.When the app starts, the cart is loaded from AsyncStorage.The app uses React Navigation to handle navigation between the HomeScreen and CartScreen.The app is designed to be modular and easy to maintain, using best practices for writing React Native apps.
